## Description

This project is a social network API built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It allows users to create and manage thoughts, reactions, and friend lists. The API supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) operations for users, thoughts, and reactions. With this API, developers can build a backend for a social networking application where users can share their thoughts, react to others' thoughts, and add friends to their network.
